        <div class="pjtText"><i>08-10-2019</i><br>
          This is my first school assignment I had to make for webdevelopment. We could make anything we like only with some requirements.
          I went with a webshop for websites. I tried to make the best work I could at the moment. The mark I got for this project is a _.

          This is a work in progress for remembering simple stuff for HTML, CSS, JavaScript and C#. I haven't even started on the C# section but
          the HTML secion already has a couple tags and is functional.

          I had to make this site for school. It was to learn the basics of HTML and CSS.

        <div class="pjtText"><i>04-07-2019</i><br>
          When I bought a DSLR camera, I made this site. It was to keep progression of the pictures I made. I haven't added pictures ever since,
          But the website is in a different style then all my other pages. It also has a dark/light theme.

        <div class="pjtText"><i>15-04-2019</i><br>
          I wanted a platform for all my content, so I could easily keep track and not lose any of it. It was a start, but I never maintained it because I didn't know that much of HTML.
          Know I am learning, and also getting back into photography and artwork. Now I have this site, with also includes projects like this one!

        <h1>First ever website</h1>
        <div class="pjtText"><i>05-12-2014</i><br>
          This was for a gamestudio I intended to start, But never did. When I made this site I was 12. So it does not really look good, but it is what started it all.
          Plus some elements don't work anymore after 5 years because I used other websites.
